# [Hey there, I'm OnceYT!](https://onceyt.github.io/)

I'm an intermediate Python developer with a passion for creating useful and efficient software. As a 2nd year business major, I've gained valuable problem-solving and analytical skills that I apply to my coding projects.

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages including Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. One of my more recent projects is a Discord bot built using the Discord.py library. Through this project, I've had the opportunity to work with various technologies and continue to improve my skills as a developer. Hit me up if you'd like a discord bot or perhaps collab on one!

Feel free to reach out to me at sahaa6919@gmail.com. I'm always open to discussing new ideas and opportunities.
