## Hey there, I'm Once! <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010387af-ad39-4c95-8874-a2a83b796ae2" width="28" height="28" />

I'm a business graduate with a passion for technology and software. I love learning new languages — both spoken and coded! As a self-taught programmer, I have learned and gained various project-based experiences working with Python, JavaScript and web structuring tools such as HTML and CSS. Some of my projects include various Discord bots serving diverse functionalities, a PyPI library for paginating Discord embeds and my personal landing site.

Feel free to reach out at [my email](https://onceyt.github.io/links/mail) — always open to discussing new ideas and opportunities!
